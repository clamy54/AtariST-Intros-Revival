# Atari ST Intro Revival

## About

This project contains **PC-based reinterpretations inspired by classic Atari ST intros and cracktros**.

It is a **non-commercial, personal project**, created **for fun and to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Atari ST**.  
The goal is to revive the *look and feel* of oldschool Atari ST intros/cracktros by **adapting classic effects to modern PC hardware**, **not** to reproduce them accurately or to run on original hardware.

## Important Notes

- Developed and run on **PC** with openGL
- **No source code is provided**
- Not an emulator, or official remake
- No claim of ownership over original works


## Legal Disclaimer

All original intros, cracktros, logos, names, and musics are the property of their respective authors.  
This project is **non-commercial** and intended strictly as a **tribute**.
